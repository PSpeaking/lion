      <p>This is a small <span class="blank" id="blank-1"></span> person tent from a well-known outdoor equipment supplier. It's cheap and does the job. I think it's in the region of £25 or £30. If you're a tall person, it's really only a one-person tent, in my opinion, and only to sleep <span class="blank" id="blank-2"></span> - but I think it's an excellent option for an uncomplicated night in a tent. It's small enough so that your body heat doesn't <span class="blank" id="blank-3"></span> too quickly in a surplus of air space, and its double skin does away with problems of <span class="blank" id="blank-4"></span>.</p>
      <p>The next vital piece of equipment is a ground <span class="blank" id="blank-5"></span>. One that acts as a good barrier to the cold, cold ground. I use again, a very cheap option, around £12 or £15, and at only an inch thick I've been surprised that, with a good sleeping bag, it hasn't let me <span class="blank" id="blank-6"></span> yet.</p>
      <p>And so we come to the next item, my <span class="blank" id="blank-7"></span> bag. It's my most expensive piece of my camping kit, around £70 I think. It keeps me warm to temperatures approaching zero. It's even got a hood to make it extra <span class="blank" id="blank-8"></span>. You wouldn't want it on a hot Spanish night. Change to a lightweight, if not sleep eau natural. In any event, if you don't have the right sleeping bag for the weather, you <span class="blank" id="blank-9"></span> gonna sleep. No fun.</p>
      <p>The type of pillow that you use, or make, may be more of a personal preference. Personally, I like to use a small inflatable, and put one or two coarse towels on top for extra support and stability, so I wake up with my head in the same <span class="blank" id="blank-10"></span> as it was when I fell asleep, and no complaints from my neck.</p>
      <p>Now I'm all set to conk out for the night or just drift off to sleep listening to <span class="blank" id="blank-11"></span>, or the gentle tap of rain, or even a good thunderstorm. It's all good when you're snug as a bug in a <span class="blank" id="blank-12"></span>.</p>
