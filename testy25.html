    <p>This is a small <input type="text" id="input-1" size="10" /> person tent from a well-known outdoor equipment supplier. It's cheap and does the job. I think it's in the region of £25 or £30. If you're a tall person, it's really only a <input type="text" id="input-2" size="10" />-person tent, in my opinion, and only to sleep <input type="text" id="input-3" size="10" /> - but I think it's an excellent option for an uncomplicated night in a tent. It's small enough so that your body heat doesn't <input type="text" id="input-4" size="10" /> too quickly in a surplus of air space, and its double skin does away with problems of <input type="text" id="input-5" size="10" />.</p>
    <p>The next vital piece of equipment is a ground <input type="text" id="input-6" size="10" />. One that provides an effective barrier against the cold ground. I use again, a very cheap option, around £12 or £15, and at only an inch thick I've been surprised that, with a good sleeping bag, it hasn't let me <input type="text" id="input-7" size="10" /> yet.</p>
    <p>And so we come to the next item, my <input type="text" id="input-8" size="10" /> bag. It's my most expensive piece of my camping kit, around £70 I think. It keeps me warm in temperatures approaching zero. It's even got a hood to make it extra <input type="text" id="input-9" size="10" />. You wouldn't want it on a hot Spanish night. Change to a lightweight, if not sleep eau naturel. In any event, if you don't have the right sleeping bag for the weather, you're not gonna sleep. No fun.</p>
    <p>The type of pillow that you use, or make, may be more of a personal preference. Personally, I like to use a small inflatable, and put one or two coarse towels on top for extra support and stability, so I wake up with my head in the same <input type="text" id="input-10" size="10" /> as it was when I fell asleep, and no complaints from my neck.</p>
    <p>Now I'm all set to conk out for the night or just drift off to sleep listening to birdsong, or the gentle tap of rain, or even a good thunderstorm. It's all good when you're snug as a bug in a rug</span>.</p>

<p>Trafalgar Square, located in the heart of London, is a renowned landmark known for its rich heritage and cultural significance. Its history and development have undergone significant changes over the years.

Architect John Nash originally designed the square in the 1830s, but it underwent extensive architectural changes by Sir Charles Barry in the mid-19th century. The square is dominated by Nelson's Column, a towering monument that commemorates Admiral Lord Nelson's victory at the Battle of Trafalgar.

Trafalgar Square has served as a major venue for various events, including political demonstrations and cultural festivals. Its fountains and statues make it a symbolic attraction, drawing tourists and locals alike.

The National Gallery, situated on the square, houses a remarkable collection of art and is a testament to London's historical significance. Visitors from around the world come to enjoy its commemorative fountains and iconic architectural architecture.

In summary, Trafalgar Square stands as a symbol of London's vibrant cultural scene, commemorating changes over time, and its continued role as a hub for public gatherings and artistic appreciation. </p>T
